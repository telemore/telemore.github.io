<h1 class="text-center header-normal">Privacy Policy</h1>

### 1. The General Data Protection Regulation
The General Data Protection Regulation 2016 (GDPR) is one of the most significant pieces of legislation affecting the way that Telemore AI LLC carries out its information processing activities. Significant fines are applicable if a breach is deemed to have occurred under the GDPR, which is designed to protect the personal data of citizens of the European Union. It is Telemore's policy to ensure that our compliance with the GDPR, The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and other relevant legislation is clear and demonstrable at all times.

### 2. Definitions
There are a total of 26 definitions listed within Article 4 â€“ Definitions of the GDPR, and it is not appropriate to reproduce them all here. However, the most fundamental definitions with respect to this policy are as follows:

- **Personal data**: "any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ('data subject'); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person."
- **Processing**: "any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organization, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction."
- **Controller**: "the natural or legal person, public authority, agency or other body which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law."

### 3. Information We Collect

Telemore collects several types of information to provide and improve our Service:

1. **Account Information**: When you register, we collect your name, email address, password, company information, and billing details.

2. **Productivity Data**: We collect information about tasks, projects, deadlines, completion metrics, and workflow patterns to provide our core productivity features.

3. **Optional Monitoring Data**: If you activate our optional monitoring features, we may collect additional data such as app usage statistics, active/idle time metrics, and productivity patterns. This data is only collected when the monitoring features are explicitly enabled.

4. **Chat Data**: When you use our AI chat features to interact with tasks or request assistance, we collect the content of these conversations to provide real-time assistance and recommendations.

5. **Usage Information**: We collect information about how you interact with our Service, including log data, device information, IP address, browser type, and usage patterns.

6. **Communications**: We store communications you have with our customer support team.

### 4. Legal Basis for Processing

Under the GDPR, we rely on the following legal bases to process your personal data:

1. **Contract Performance**: We process account information and productivity data as necessary to perform our contract with you (providing the Telemore service).

2. **Legitimate Interests**: We process usage information and system logs based on our legitimate interests in:
    - Ensuring the security and proper functioning of our services
    - Analyzing and improving our product features
    - Protecting against fraudulent or illegal activity

3. **Consent**: We rely on your consent for:
    - Optional monitoring features (which can be withdrawn at any time)
    - Marketing communications
    - Certain cookies and tracking technologies

4. **Legal Obligations**: We process personal data as necessary to comply with applicable laws, including tax, security, and data protection regulations.

For clients using our optional monitoring features, you must ensure you have an appropriate legal basis for monitoring employee activities, which may include legitimate interests, consent, or contract performance depending on your jurisdiction and specific circumstances.

### 5. AI Processing and Data Usage

Telemore leverages artificial intelligence to enhance productivity through task management and workflow optimization:

1. **AI Data Processing**: Our AI systems process your productivity data and chat interactions to provide personalized recommendations, task prioritization, and workflow insights. These AI-generated recommendations are associated with your specific tasks and work patterns.

2. **AI Data Security**: AI processing occurs via Amazon Bedrock and similar services. Your data is processed in secure environments with strict access controls.

3. **No Training on Your Data**: Your data is not used to train our AI models. We do not use your content, communications, or task information to improve our AI systems for other customers.

4. **Session-Based Processing**: AI-generated responses are not stored beyond your active session unless needed to provide the Service. Your interactions with our AI are transient and used solely to generate relevant recommendations for your specific workflows.

5. **Human Review**: Our systems are designed to minimize human review of your data. When human review is necessary for troubleshooting or quality assurance, we take steps to anonymize user data to the extent feasible while still enabling resolution of the specific issue.

### 6. Workplace Monitoring Privacy Practices

Our optional employee monitoring features require special attention to privacy and compliance:

1. **Notice and Consent**: We strongly recommend that clients using our monitoring features provide clear notice to employees about what data is being collected and how it will be used. Templates for employee notification are available in our documentation.

2. **Minimization and Proportionality**: Our monitoring tools are designed with privacy in mind, collecting only data that is relevant to legitimate productivity assessment. Clients can configure the level of detail collected to ensure proportionality.

3. **Transparency Controls**: Employees can be provided with visibility into what is being monitored through optional dashboard features that show what data is collected and when monitoring is active.

4. **Compliance Support**: We provide resources to help clients comply with relevant workplace privacy regulations in their jurisdictions, but clients remain responsible for ensuring their use of our monitoring features complies with applicable laws.

5. **Separation of Core and Monitoring Features**: Our productivity tools function independently from monitoring features, allowing clients to use core productivity features without enabling monitoring functionality if desired.

### 7. Data Security Measures

We implement and maintain appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal data:

1. **Encryption**: All data is encrypted both at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption protocols (AES-256 and TLS 1.3).

2. **Access Controls**: We enforce strict role-based access controls and multi-factor authentication for all staff accessing systems containing personal data.

3. **Monitoring and Testing**: We conduct regular security monitoring, vulnerability scanning, and penetration testing of our systems.

4. **Incident Response**: We maintain a comprehensive incident response plan with designated responsibilities to quickly address any potential security events.

5. **Vendor Assessment**: We thoroughly vet all third-party service providers for appropriate security practices before engaging them.

These security measures are regularly reviewed and updated to address new threats and vulnerabilities. While we implement best practices for security, no system can guarantee absolute security. We encourage users to help by maintaining strong passwords and reporting any suspicious activities.

### 8. Principles relating to processing of personal data
Personal data shall be:
- Processed lawfully, fairly, and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject ('lawfulness, fairness, and transparency').
- Collected for specified, explicit, and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes ('purpose limitation').
- Adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed ('data minimization').
- Accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date ('accuracy').
- Kept in a form that permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed ('storage limitation').
- Processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorized or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organizational measures ('integrity and confidentiality').
- The controller shall be responsible for, and able to demonstrate, compliance with all these principles ('accountability').

Telemore AI LLC must ensure that it complies with all these principles both in the processing it currently carries out and as part of the introduction of new methods of processing such as new IT systems. The operation of an information security management system (ISMS) that conforms to the ISO/IEC 27001 international standard is a key part of that commitment.

### 9. Data Retention

Telemore retains different types of data for varying periods based on business needs and legal requirements:

1. **Account Information**: We retain your account information for as long as your account is active and for a period thereafter to comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements.

2. **Productivity Data**: Task data, workflows, and productivity metrics are retained for the duration of your subscription and for 30 days after termination to allow for potential account reactivation.

3. **Optional Monitoring Data**: Monitoring data is retained for a shorter period, typically 90 days, after which it is automatically deleted unless regulatory requirements necessitate longer retention.

4. **Chat Interactions**: AI chat conversations are retained only for the duration needed to provide the service and are not stored beyond your active session except as needed to troubleshoot specific issues.

5. **System Logs**: For security, compliance, and operational integrity purposes, system logs are retained for 10 years. These logs contain technical information about service operation but do not include the content of your tasks or communications.

Upon subscription termination, you may request prompt deletion of all your data (except system logs required for security and compliance) by contacting support@telemore.ai, and we will complete this deletion within 30 days of your request.

### 10. Data Deletion Procedures

When you request deletion of your personal data:

1. **Verification**: We will verify your identity through appropriate means, which may include confirming through your registered email address or requesting additional verification information.

2. **Deletion Process**: Upon verification, we will delete your personal data from our active systems within 30 days. This includes:
    - Account information
    - Productivity data
    - Chat histories
    - Optional monitoring data

3. **Retention Exceptions**: Certain information may be retained for limited purposes:
    - System logs (retained for 10 years for security and compliance)
    - Anonymized statistical data that no longer identifies you
    - Information necessary to comply with legal obligations or establish, exercise, or defend legal claims

4. **Confirmation**: Upon completion of the deletion process, we will provide confirmation of deletion.

5. **Third Parties**: We will take reasonable steps to inform any third-party processors with whom we have shared your data to delete their copies of your data.

Data deletion is a permanent action and cannot be reversed once completed.

### 11. Rights of the individuals
The data subject also has rights. These consist of:
- The right to be informed.
- The right of access.
- The right to rectification.
- The right to erasure.
- The right to restrict processing.
- The right to data portability.
- The right to object.
- Rights in relation to automated decision-making and profiling.

"To protect the integrity and security of our internal systems, we may limit access to specific details about how your data is processed, where such disclosure would compromise proprietary methods or allow for system manipulation. We are committed to balancing transparency with the need to maintain secure and reliable services."

Each of these rights must be supported by appropriate procedures within Telemore AI LLC that allow the required action to be taken within the timescales stated in the regulations.

### 12. Data Portability

Under applicable privacy laws, you have the right to receive your personal data in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format:

1. **Available Formats**: When you exercise your right to data portability, we will provide your data in one of the following formats:
    - JSON
    - CSV
    - PDF (for reports and non-structured data)

2. **Included Data**: Portable data will include:
    - Account information
    - Task and productivity data

    - Specify your preferred format
    - Allow up to 30 days for processing

Data provided through our portability process is designed to be easily transferable to other services where technically feasible.

### 13. Automated Decision-Making and Profiling

1. **AI-Generated Recommendations**: Telemore uses automated processing to provide productivity recommendations and task insights. These recommendations:
    - Are directly tied to your task data and workflows
    - Suggest efficiency improvements and prioritization strategies
    - Do not involve decisions with legal or similarly significant effects

2. **User Control**: You maintain control over automated recommendations by:
    - Choosing whether to follow or ignore suggestions
    - Providing feedback that improves recommendation relevance
    - Setting preferences for the types of recommendations you receive

3. **Optional Monitoring Features**: If enabled, our monitoring features may use automated analysis to generate productivity insights, but:
    - These insights are intended as guidance, not evaluation
    - Final decisions about employee performance should involve human review
    - You can request human intervention for any automated assessment

If you have concerns about any automated processing of your data, please contact us at support@telemore.ai.

### 14. California Privacy Rights

If you are a California resident, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provides you with specific rights regarding your personal information:

1. **Right to Know**: You have the right to request information about the personal information we collect, use, disclose, and sell.

2. **Right to Delete**: You have the right to request deletion of personal information we have collected about you, subject to certain exceptions necessary for providing our service or legal compliance.

3. **Right to Opt-Out**: While Telemore does not sell personal information as traditionally defined, California residents have the right to opt-out of certain data sharing practices classified as "sales" under the CCPA.

4. **Right to Non-Discrimination**: We will not discriminate against you for exercising any of your CCPA rights.

To exercise these rights, please contact us at support@telemore.ai. We will respond to verifiable consumer requests within 45 days. You may make a request up to twice within a 12-month period.

For verification purposes, we may need to request specific information to confirm your identity. This is a security measure to ensure personal information is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals.

### 15. Age Restrictions and Requirements

Telemore's services are designed for users who are at least 18 years of age. We do not knowingly collect personal information from individuals under 18 years old.

If we learn that we have collected personal information from a person under 18, we will promptly delete that information. If you believe we might have collected information from a person under 18, please contact us at support@telemore.ai.

For EU users, where the age of consent for data processing may vary between 13-16 years depending on the member state, we require parental consent for users under 16 years of age.

### 16. Consent
Unless it is necessary for a reason allowable in the regulations, consent must be obtained from a data subject to collect and process their data. In the case of children below the age of 16 (Note â€“ this age may be lower in individual EU member states), parental consent must be obtained. Transparent information about our usage of their personal data must be provided to data subjects at the time that consent is obtained, and their rights regarding their data explained, such as the right to withdraw consent. This information must be provided in an accessible form, written in clear language, and free of charge.

If the personal data are not obtained directly from the data subject, then this information must be provided within a reasonable period after the data are obtained and definitely within one month.

### 18. Privacy by design
Telemore AI LLC has adopted the principle of privacy by design and will ensure that the definition and planning of all new or significantly changed systems that collect or process personal data will be subject to due consideration of privacy issues, including the completion of one or more privacy (also known as data protection) impact assessments.

The privacy impact assessment will include:
- Consideration of how personal data will be processed and for what purposes.
- Assessment of whether the proposed processing of personal data is both necessary and proportionate to the purpose(s).
- Assessment of the risks to individuals in processing the personal data.
- What controls are necessary to address the identified risks and demonstrate compliance with legislation.

Use of techniques such as data minimization and pseudo-anonymization will be considered where applicable and appropriate.

### 19. Third-Party Data Processors

To provide our Service, Telemore works with trusted third-party service providers who may process your data:

1. **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**: Our primary infrastructure provider hosts all Telemore services and data. AWS maintains industry-leading security practices and complies with major security certifications including ISO 27001, SOC 2, and GDPR requirements.

2. **Amazon Bedrock**: We utilize Amazon Bedrock for certain AI processing capabilities. All data processed through Amazon Bedrock is subject to AWS's security controls and is not used to train Amazon's AI models.

3. **Payment Processors**: We use industry-standard payment processors to handle subscription payments. We do not store complete credit card information on our servers.

These service providers are contractually obligated to handle your data in compliance with applicable privacy laws and our instructions. We regularly review their security and privacy practices to ensure compliance with our standards.

3. **Security Measures**: Regardless of where your data is processed, we maintain appropriate technical and organizational safeguards to protect your personal information according to the standards required by applicable laws.

4. **Data Protection Impact Assessments**: Where required by law, we conduct data protection impact assessments for cross-border transfers to ensure adequate protection of transferred data.

If you have questions about our international data practices, please contact us at support@telemore.ai.

### 22. Data protection officer
A defined role of Data Protection Officer (DPO) is required under the GDPR if an organization is a public authority, if it performs large-scale monitoring, or if it processes particularly sensitive types of data on a large scale. Based on these criteria, Telemore AI LLC does not require a Data Protection Officer to be appointed.

### 23. Breach notification
It is Telemore's policy to be fair and proportionate when considering the actions to be taken to inform affected parties regarding breaches of personal data. In line with the GDPR, where a breach is known to have occurred which is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, the relevant supervisory authority will be informed within 72 hours.
